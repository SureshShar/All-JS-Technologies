/* To learn more about this file see: https://angular.io/config/tsconfig. 
* TypeScript is a primary language for Angular application development. 
* It is a superset of JavaScript with design-time support for type safety and tooling.
* Browsers can't execute TypeScript directly. Typescript must be "transpiled" into JavaScript
* using the tsc compiler, which requires some configuration.
* This page covers some aspects of TypeScript configuration and the TypeScript environment 
* that are important to Angular developers.
