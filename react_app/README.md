## Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

1. Starts the development server.
  `npm run start`

2. Bundles the app into static files for production.
  `npm run build`

3. Starts the test runner.
  `npm test`

4. Removes this tool and copies build dependencies configuration files
and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!
  `npm run eject`

Happy hacking!
